# Arduino Projects

This is a collection of Arduino projects that don't really deserve their own repository.

None of them are really maintained. Feel free to poke around and create pull requests if you have some improvment.

## Projects

### [Guitar](../master/guitar)

* *Project type: Arduino IDE (.ino)*

Simple "guitar" where I used a distance sensor to map distance to a tone and play it through a piezo. You can read more about this project on my [blog](http://engineerish.com/post/148459701886/arduino-guitar).

### [Party Glasses](../master/party-glasses)

* *Project type: Arduino IDE (.ino)*

Two neopixel rings, attached to a pair of sunglasses. [Blog post](http://engineerish.com/post/151660128666/tutorial-party-glasses)

### [Pushup counter](../master/pushups)

* *Project type: PlatformIO (.cpp)*

A box to which I mounted a 4-digit LCD display and a distance sensor to.

### [Mini Instagram Stats](../master/mini-ig-stats)

* *Project type: Particle Photon (.ino)*

RGB led that indicates when you get a new follower or someone likes your posts on Instagram. A two-part project with a webserver in Node.js and a Photon communicating with it.
